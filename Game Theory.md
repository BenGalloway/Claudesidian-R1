# Game Theory can be fun too
---
You have mastered the art of the heist.  It's been just the two of you, for the last decade gallivanting across the world visiting the most exotic locations searching for your next mark.  And then after they've been hit, you go looking for a different sort of exotic, one that's only ever found [[off the beaten path]] of the already ill fated [[path less travelled]].  But this location, this is your special place, where the two of you get to celebrate with just each other.  Funds tucked away in a Swiss bank account routed through the Cayman islands to name on of the dozen or so.  But this one is different, this one is the last one, your getting older, and so is she.  You've had to have this conversation more often than you've wanted to over the last couple years.  You hate the idea of getting out of the game, but just last week in the outskirts of Jerusalem you noticed the extra effort it took to climb the stairs.  The mind, still sharp, the fitness, still tip-top.  But it's starting to wane.  So you came to an agreement.  One more, THE one more.  The big one every thief and alley cat that's ever wandered this trail hasn't really ever gotten to.  The [[system]] is impeccable, it's [[complexity in simplicity]]. It's allowed for your various accounts to experience substantial [[growth]].  But it's come the time to hang it up.

You've come to love and [[trust]] this other person explicitly, trusted them with your life on more than one occasion.  You think you know them like [[Family]].  But that system and all of it's simplicity relies on [[trust]] in another person.  Who as we'll discover has the free will to make a [[choice]] to [[betray]] you, or [[be cooperative]].  
## outcomes: 
1) things work out as they always have, the trust stays intact. You each walk away with your respective half.
2) One of you choses to [[betray]] the other, taking everything, leaving the other with nothing.  Tempting, no?
3) You both share the betrayal idea, and spend so much time arguing, struggling, bickering or fighting you fall into the preverbal mouse trap that every thief finds themselves in across literature and film.  But unlike those mediums, there is no escape plan you're caught, and neither of you gets anything.

Now, the only stipulation to play this game, just like it is in the scenario above, you can not [[communicate]] with the other player.  That could give everything away, blow your cover so to speak.  It is strictly forbidden.  So, if we were to play this game 100 times repeatedly, with memory of the previous results, what would your [[strategy]] be?
