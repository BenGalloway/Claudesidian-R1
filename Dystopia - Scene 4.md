The recordings analog origin was beginning to betray its age. Infiltrated by inconsistency. Clicks and pops distorting the material preserved within.

"The manual of truth that Friday evening had the exact same times and location as the previous instructions"
___
William was dressed, ready to leave.  Before he walked out of the sleeping room, he turned around, staring at Wanda as she slept. He had an extra 37 seconds to spare after all.

Arriving at the rear entrance he was greeted by another page. This was the first deviation in the instructions up to this point. The instructions read there seemed to loosen a tight section of his pectoral region he hadn't noticed on the walk there.

*Proceed to sublevel 2, find the door labeled Records: broken, medical, vinyl*

Upon reaching the familiar section of sublevel 2 he realized he must have progressed too far when he read the door labeled:
Retarders: Flame, Water, Brain
So he turned and scanned and found the label he was silently mouthing to himself. 

*A competent memory retention tool* he thought.

Nestled there between doors "Supple: Teat, Fruit, Treat" and "Remission: Cancer, Debt, Religious" he found the door labeled "Records". 

Opening it, William saw a single object centered in the room on a table. Some object that on knocking on the side he concluded could only be a hard organic material. 

A specific name for the material couldn't be produced by William. As, no manual he could recite covered an organic material having a metallic protrusion that exponentially gained volume as it took a suboptimal path. The path lead to an opening with a circumference greater than William's head. 

The metal extension seemed to hover over a familiar material at least. It was a plastic-like texture. William discovered there were ridges at seemingly random intervals.

*What poor workmanship*.


After concluding there were no more extremities to this object, he raised his head to find the room was larger than his vision registered when entering. 

He estimated it to be only marginally smaller than the room he absorbed the projection in. The difference here was there were no seating prototypes. Simple, white squares stacked non-uniformly to one side. With the largest single piece of fabric, apparently suspended somehow, across from the boxes. It also appeared to be uncared for. As it seemed to be in need of a hot pressing. 

With no new manual entry plainly evident William began to wander the space. As his route brought him close to the suspension of fabric he put the face of his hand out and discovered the fabric was unnatural in its weight. 

The texture didn't seem to match the weight his hand felt. 

*Something this dense isn't meant to be....* 

William didn't know the correct syntax for this sensory input.  His gastrointestinal system began to tighten. Replacing the discomfort from his pectoral region. 

His fingers continued examining the physics defiant material.

*This would have been superior to the tweed on the seating prototype*.

In the instant this thought passed through, William's hand found a gap. Allowing something he recognized to pierce the darkness. He grabbed a prehensile full of the fabric and walked backwards with it. 

Exposing his dilated pupils to an over bright source of yellow tinted lumens. Causing him to not shut his eyes completely, but not letting him see much at all.

Then a *squelch* and pop, followed by a voice that reminded William of Christina A. Chris A's co-anchor. But it wasn't her voice, it seemed less.....abrasive. And seemed present around William in all places at once. 

"You have done well in your absorption of this manual. Continue with this mindset, and you will be the first to complete the manual of truth"
___
Those present in the room were so captured with the narration at this moment the hiss, omnipresent, was lost to the screaming tension. 

"By the time my biological perception was calibrated to the self-imposed extreme lumen exposure, nothing visual matched the manipulated sonic vibrations present at that moment."

"The portion of the manual presented to me at that moment was not projected. It was also something that was unable to be understood through alternative type of absorption, reading.  It was simply an audible section, that did not present any words".

"Instead, it made you aware of its presence by penetrating the very anatomy with the masculine sonic vibrations. And it offered instruction through the feminine vibrations. The most powerful instructions came when the masculine voice and the feminine voice were synchronized. Delivering a message that was forceful enough...."

There was a slight crack in the voice.

A collective breath being held.

Until the voice returned, "THIS INSTRUCTION CAUSED AN INVOLUNTARY VERTICAL MOTION IN MY LEFT METATARSAL'S!!"

And suddenly the voice cut away again, with a scraping noise as accompaniment.  

*Silence*

*Silence*

*A deep exhale*

"Apologies for the unwarned outburst."
