*This has to be the spot. It's the only place that makes sense. 

If I want anything to change I have to go in.

Next pass. I'm opening that fucking door*

With one final careful glance around over his shoulder, he grabbed the metal door handle.  The difference in temperature may as well have sent electric charges up his arm and into his shoulder as he paused for a moment, twisted, and entered.

Panting, with panic induced frenzy, fumbles to find the deadbolt and lock the door behind him. 

Turning his attention away from the door he sees a small, mostly bare concrete room.  Furnished with a solitary metal table and chair.  Set up with some kind of big box attached to a microphone. In front of the microphone a note. 

It reads: *"It's simple really, we just need you to find the red circle on the box and tell us just one more time what you've already told us.  Don't worry, we'll hear you.
-Eazy Peazy"*

*A-fucking-gain?!*
