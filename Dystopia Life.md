Unsure of length yet, first idea that came to me is this:

Sweat pooling his eyes despite the cool early morning mist that shrouds half the street. Eyelids glued to his forehead, unable to remember the last time sleep was even a probability.

*This has to be the spot. It's the only place that makes sense. 

If I want anything to change I have to go in.

Next pass. I'm opening that fucking door*

With one final careful glance around over his shoulder, he grabbed the metal door handle.  The difference in temperature may as well have sent electric charges up his arm and into his shoulder as he paused for a moment, twisted, and entered.

Panting, with panic induced frenzy, fumbles to find the deadbolt and lock the door behind him. 

Turning his attention away from the door he sees a small, mostly bare concrete room.  Furnished with a solitary metal table and chair.  Set up with some kind of big box attached to a microphone. In front of the microphone a note. 

It reads: *"It's simple really, we just need you to find the red circle on the box, press it, and tell us just one more time what you've already told us.  Don't worry, we'll hear you.
-Eazy Peazy"*

"A-fucking-gain?!"

As the exclamation finished rolling off his tongue he flinched.  Swinging his whole body with a glare more fit for casting lasers than staring.  

After a few moments he realized he had forgotten to breath, and forced himself to take a deep, slow suck of air in to help slow his heart.

"Just like the manual of health said, count to 4 in, and 8 out."

"Okay, the manual said to look for a red circle.  Just one more time."

Finally taking the seat, still oddly speaking aloud with nobody else around, "Okay, I've watched the Gooberment people use this.  And they aren't as used to it is the Webby news anchors, so it can't be that hard."

Investigating the microphone tentatively with his fingers, like it might be poisoned, a throat clears followed by a voice, now with more confidence follow's, "My name is William Ford, and I'm here to tell you....shit.  What color and shape was it again?"  

William never claimed to be the most colorful crayon, or knew what a crayon was.

"Ah-ha, red circle." A thin plastic *thunk*, then, "My Name is William Ford, and I read a manual that doesn't exist in the libraries as we know them."
