Traveling slumber. Contorted and uncomfortable. 6 souls rest. 1 is left to navigate trouble. 

Splatter hits the windows. Followed by the first crack of thunder. The sky went dark long ago. Will this get worse? The one waking soul can only wonder. 

Traversing the dark, mysteries he's unable to uncover. It is just there to endure. He is the keeper away of trouble. 

Rain in the sky sags clouds low. No moon in the sky leaves this detail covered. Those first splatters turn to more and more, each faster than the other.
