Be aware of the marks men ask for you to leave on their hearts

For every scar there becomes a wound a man is determined to wear

Bloodied, flesh tattered to shreds
Through any fire, they willfully carry your curse
They endure this torture, silent, for better, for worse

Being unable to share the pain,
Told from an early age it's thiers alone to bear

Sweet woman please listen close
As these words are spoken less often than most

Be weary of what you say to the man that has given you his heart

Not because of his red faced anger that it could spark

But because a man has surrended and given you his life, his pulse, his ever beating heart

With it you may do as wish,
for every mark and transgression made a price must be paid 

Not by the maker,
But by the soul that is chained to the heart you've attained. 

Words cut sharper than swords or knives, 
And men are frowned up just attempting to riposte.

Surrending to fate, exuberantly, with no emotion other than glee,
Men tie their own hands behind their backs,
Giving you the largest opening to their chest, master swordsmen would excite so quickly they might lose all their class,

But you, oh sweet woman, you taunt and tease before a sudden thrush and slash

Left mentally broken, bleeding his last,
The man smiles, recognizing his heart was taken by his one true woman, his only, his last
___
​Be wary of the marks a man asks you to carve upon his chest;

For every scar is a ledger reading the weight he’s silently sworn to bear.

He offers up the meat, the tattered fringe of soul and skin,

And walks through white-hot coals to keep the soot from off your chin.

He carries every curse you cast, a silent, heavy yoke,

Enduring every hammer blow until his iron’s broke.

​He learned the trade of silence in the winter of his youth

That a man’s own blood is the only ink required for the truth.

His one true love, promised only his word, his most sacred oath

​Sweet woman, lean in close and hear the rattle in his lungs,

The words he stifles daily with a thousand salted tongues:

Be careful with the blade you swing at the man who’s dropped his guard,

Not for the red-faced "anger" that the stinging blow might spark,

But because he’s unslung the shield and unbuckled every plate,

Leaving the soft, wet pulse of life to the whimsy of your hate.

​With that heart, you may do exactly as you wish;

But know that for every shallow nick, a deep price must be paid, one deeper if there's a flinch

Not by the one who swung the steel, but by the one who refuses to riposte.

But by the soul chained to the pump, the heart that is ripped from the chest of its host,

It's what feeds the very life you're teasing with death,

spark by jagged spark, your words burn through the simple cloth, his only clothing left.

And a man is shamed for reaching for a whetstone of his own.

So he surrenders to the "glee," a frantic, giddy joy,

He ties his own hands behind his back like a broken, wooden toy.

He offers up the hearts home, the broad space of his breast

A target so wide and stationary, a novice would be blessed.

​But you, oh sweet woman, you don’t go for a quick, clean strike

You tease the point against the ribs, tasing for the thrill.

You find the gaps between the cage, where the space is made,

And lean your weight into the hilt, burying your blade

​Left mentally unstrung, the copper scent of life upon the floor,

The man smiles through the grit and teeth, a soldier in your war.

He recognizes the hand that twisted the metal in the gap,

And dies content to know his heart was caught within your trap.
