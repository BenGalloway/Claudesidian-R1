Be aware of the marks men ask for you to leave on their hearts

For every scar there becomes a wound a man is determined to wear

Bloodied, flesh tattered to shreds
Through any fire, they willfully carry your curse
They endure this torture, silent, for better, for worse

Being unable to share the pain,
Told from an early age it's thiers alone to bear

Sweet woman please listen close
As these words are spoken less often than most

Be weary of what you say to the man that has given you his heart

Not because of his red faced anger that it could spark

But because a man has surrended and given you his life, his pulse, his ever beating heart

With it you may do as wish,
for every mark and transgression made a price must be paid 

Not by the maker,
But by the soul that is chained to the heart you've attained. 

Words cut sharper than swords or knives, 
And men are frowned up just attempting to riposte.

Surrending to fate, exuberantly, with no emotion other than glee,
Men tie their own hands behind their backs,
Giving you the largest opening to their chest, master swordsmen would excite so quickly they might lose all their class,

But you, oh sweet woman, you taunt and tease before a sudden thrush and slash

Left mentally broken, bleeding his last,
The man smiles, recognizing his heart was taken by his one true woman, his only, his last
