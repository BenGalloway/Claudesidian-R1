Be aware of the marks men ask for you to leave on their hearts

For every scar there becomes a wound that man will wear

Bloodied, flesh torn to shreds
For better or worse, 
Through any fire, they willfully carry your curse

Of being unable to share the pain it is that they bear

Sweet woman please listen close
As these words are spoken less often than most

Be weary of what you say to the man that has given you his heart

Not because of his red faced anger that it could spark

But because a man has surrended and given you his life, his pulse, his ever beating heart

With it you may do as wish,
for every mark and transgression made a price must be paid 

Not by the maker
But by the one who gave you the freedom to make
