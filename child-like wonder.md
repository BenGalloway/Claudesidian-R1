If you have kids, you've seen this scene play out hundreds (or thousands) of times: kid gets a new toy, becomes obsessed with getting it out of the packaging, until the box is in the bin and the "newness" wears off. Then you find that tantrum inducing toy in all sorts of strange places. Under the couch or bed. With bits of it chipped away, stickers peeling at the corners, now resigned to a dark life at the bottom of a toy box. Just days after it was new, and it is infuriating. 

Something worth screaming about yesterday has suddenly become an after thought. 

But you keep it, maybe out of guilt, potentially out of spite, and then even you forget about it.

Fast forward a couple months, you see your child holding that same toy, with the same glint in their eyes as when they first saw it. And it's being used, not as a single "thing", but part of a more cohesive unit of play. The object wasn't forgotten, it was simply waiting for its purpose to be revealed naturally.  

The kid obsessed, not because it was new, but because they knew it had a place, and the fit they threw was because they didn't know where that place was yet. They needed to put all their senses together in addition to a little time to unlock the trail they knew existed, but couldn't map out.

This ability to connect via obscure pathways is effectively taught out of us as we grow older and attend schools in the modern educational system. [^1] 

Think for a second; that term paper, that lit comprehension essay, the math homework, how often did you *revisit* the material *in order to connect it to the new lessons being taught later?*

Compared to what actually happened. Marching onwards, through to the next chapter, the next lesson plan, the next literary analysis paper. A child hasn't had the free association, the child-like wonder, taught out of them yet. So, when they circle back to something, they see it from a fresh perspective. One with experiences that shine like a light through a crystal, showing a spectrum that wasn't there before. Because their experience had not shown them that it exists until that moment the synapses fire and they [[let connections reveal themselves]].

The good news is this, by reading this...thing (essay sounds too formal, complete thoughts aren't typically structured, and this is definitely not a book, idfk man labels are stupid) you're effectively witnessing that you can, in fact, change that. 

I absolutely abhor writing about myself, so bear with me for a minute. The title of this article (yeah, that fits better) has sat in my personal obsidian vault for roughly a year. Created, put down, and left at the bottom of my mental "toy box". Nearly forgotten about, until today.  

Then, I read something, saw that title, and suddenly the images of what I described in my opening, were my own kids, playing out like a tragic comedy somewhere between my eyes and frontal lobe, for just me. And I could finally articulate what the thought meant in a way I couldn't a year ago.

And that's the whole point. The thought carried enough emotional weight in the moment. Without being completely formed, that emotional weight was either a burden to carry, or an expression that required a release.  I didn't know why it needed to be let go of, or what it would become.  It sat, Incubated at the bottom of my creative toy box. Only to be discovered again, with more time having passed, and the glint of a fleeting thought turns into a flame of creational momentum. 

Culminating in an output that is unique, inspired, and entirely my own.  

You can unlearn the linear method pounded into your head starting in kindergarten (first year of school in the U.S.). You can learn to have a child-like wonder, exploring, experimenting, and most importantly ***FAILING.*** 

So many people throw things away, or into a junk drawer, and forget they exist.  Inevitably purchasing a replacement that wasn't necessary in the first place. That's just an example using a nominal household item. As humans we can generate potentially thousands of thoughts a day, most of them discarded because they don't operate within a self imposed linear model we use to think and connect. I got tired of throwing those away, and this is me doing something about it.
