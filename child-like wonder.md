If you have kids, you've seen this play out hundreds (or thousands) of times: new toy is obtained, and becomes something of an obsession until the box is in the bin and the shiny "newness" wears off. Then you find the pieces of that tantrum inducing toy in all sorts of strange places. Under the couch, or a bed, chipped off bits resigned to a dark life at the bottom of a toy box, and it is infuriating.  Something that was worth screaming about just a few days ago l, has become little more than an after thought. But you keep it, maybe out of guilt, potentially out of spite, and then you yourself forget about it. Fast forward a couple months and you see your child holding that same toy, with the same glint they had in their eyes as they had when they first saw it. And it's being used, less like a singular object, and part of a more cohesive unit of play. The object was not forgotten, it was simply waiting on its purpose.  Your kid obsessed, not because it was new, but because they knew it had a place, and they forgot about it because they couldn't immediately figure it exactly where that place was.
