It's been exactly 1 week since the famed actor Robert Duvall passed on. Naturally, more clips began to arise of some of his best acting moments across even the most secluded corners of the internet.  

A man whose work was enjoyed by multiple generations, the clip that captured my attention was the bar fight scene in 2003's *Secondhand Lions.* It's released coincided with my 3rd year of grade school, making me around 9 years old. I didn't see the movie until somewhere in middle school. It quickly became one of my favorites and was watched multiple times at different stages of my own life. 

But I haven't watched it since I had my own children. Which soon will grow to a total of 5. So with the oldest being 7, I decided it was time to share with them to one of my favorite movies, carried through early adolescence into adulthood. 

In the age of cartoons like Bluey, and characters like Blippi and Miss Rachel, my excitement was hampered slightly by the potential for loss of interest in something "old".  What I saw from them was a genuine enjoyment for something I believe is "timeless".

Not only did they sit through the whole film, they told me how much they were enjoying it, and how good I was at picking movies to watch. 

Even with the pride that filled me with, the enjoyment for me wasn't derived from pride, it was from them enjoying something that might be forgotten in a week, may never become a favorite of there's. But it was enjoyed as something they all knew to enjoyed by an "old guy".

They didn't see the undertones of greed. They didn't understand how the conclusion showed that you have the ability to choose your family. Nor did they comprehend that no matter how old you get, you can remain a child at heart. You just need to allow yourself that freedom as Garth and Hub did. 

These are all things, that as their parent, fall to me to teach them. But at 7, 4, 2, and soon to be born I don't quite have the vocabulary necessary to teach them. So I used the screen (oh, no! Terrible parent alert! Get over yourself.) to aid me in introducing those topics. It just so happened to be in a manner that made them laugh along the way. Something I'm not capable of currently. 

Genuinely, I just hope they can see that men are capable of being simultaneously tough and tender. Without giving up their ability to be "masculine"
