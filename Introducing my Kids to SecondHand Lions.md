It's been exactly 1 week since the famed actor Robert Duvall passed on. Naturally, more clips began to arise of some of his best acting moments across even the most secluded corners of the internet.  

A man whose work was enjoyed by multiple generations, the clip that captured my attention was the bar fight scene in 2003's *Secondhand Lions.* It's released coincided with my 3rd year of grade school, making me around 9 years old. I didn't see the movie until somewhere in middle school. It quickly became one of my favorites and was watched multiple times at different stages of my own life. 

But I haven't watched it since I had my own children.
