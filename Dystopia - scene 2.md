Prev: [[Dystopia - Scene 1]]

William begins his descent into Infrastructure, Inc's lesser know sub-level basement system.

An average man in his late 30's, William has worked for Infrastructure Inc since the day he finished his primary educational curriculum. Much like the majority of his peers.  And just like their parents before them, and their parents before that. 

Try as he might William was unable to reach the status of "exemplary" within the curriculum. Those that did received special placement into the "advanced curriculum", which translates to William as important enough work to not be seen after primary.

As his first foot descends onto sub-level 2's floor it strikes William, *20 years navigating within this building for work related tasks and I've never been made aware this portion of the building was constructed.*

William begins to review the labels on the various doors as he passes each.  

Retarders: Flame, Water, Brain.
Safety: Vests, Lights, First.
Scales: Reptile, Weight, Metric, Non-Metric.

Finally coming across the one he was scanning for, remembering the manual's instruction, *Enter there, find a seat.* he crosses the threshold and is immediately attacked with an unfamiliar smell.  Registering to William as stale, and unsanitized, with particles visibly suspended in the lone light beam illuminating the space. 

*The sanitary team must be behind schedule again.* 


Analyzing the room in order to accomplish the manual's next instruction, William uses the moderately obstructed light and sees the shade of an outline resembling the back of a chair.

When he reaches the seating side of the chair his eyes widen, as he's unsure how the chair operates. The portion of the chair responsible for placing the posterior is in an unnatural position for such. It appears to William as if the chair was folded like a document being prepped for mail delivery.
