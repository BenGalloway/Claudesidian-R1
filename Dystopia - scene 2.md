Prev: [[Dystopia - Scene 1]]

William begins his descent into Infrastructure, Inc's lesser know sub-level basement system.

An average man in his late 30's, William has worked for Infrastructure Inc since the day he finished his primary educational curriculum. Much like the majority of his peers.  And just like their parents before them, and their parents before that. 

Try as he might William was unable to reach the status of "exemplary" within the curriculum. Those that did received special placement into the "advanced curriculum", which translates to William as important enough work to not be seen after primary.

As his first foot descends onto sub-level 2's floor it strikes William, *20 years navigating within this building for work related tasks and I've never been made aware this portion of the building was constructed.*

William begins to review the labels on the various doors as he passes each.  

Retarders: Flame, Water, Brain.
Safety: Vests, Lights, First.
Scales: Reptile, Weight, Metric, Non-Metric.

Finally coming across the one he was scanning for, remembering the manual's instruction, *Enter there, find a seat.* he crosses the threshold and is immediately attacked with an unfamiliar smell.  Registering to William as stale, and unsanitized, with particles visibly suspended in the lone light beam illuminating the space. 

*The sanitary team must be behind schedule again.* 


Analyzing the room in order to accomplish the manual's next instruction, William uses the moderately obstructed light and sees the shade of an outline resembling the back of a chair.

When he reaches the seating side of the chair his eyes widen, as he's unsure how the chair operates. The portion of the chair responsible for placing the posterior is in an unnatural position for such. It appears to William as if the chair was folded like a manual page being prepped for mail delivery to a new promotion from primary education. 

With an unnatural seat seemingly the standard by looking at the other seats in line with this one, William attempts to prop himself on what should be the edge of a seat.

***THUNK***!

The absurdity of the folded chair gets worse.  As William feels a sudden but brief sensation of falling into his much more accustomed position. 

Oddly, it caused minimal pain for William. A fall like that on any chair he'd sat in up to this point of existence very well could have shattered his coccyx as the anatomy manual called it. 

Feeling his newly altered chair for any mother potential stresses or fractures he discovers there is a material present.  It feels to him like the thick tweed jackets used by the men in the community during the winter. 

*But why would you leave your jacket on a malfunctioning chair?*

And as he continued feeling the oddly covered seat he found the reason nothing had broken. The tweed material had covered some kind of sponge. Much like the one used for dish sanitizing, only this one didn't leave his fingers wrinkled from over saturated conditions. It also appeared to have a much quicker mechanical rebound function compared with the dish sponge. 

None of these things had ever presented themselves in a manner that would facilitate William to produce the combination he now found his body placed on. And he at this very moment was enamoured with this over engineering from the seating technology department.

*The Gooberment officials and President Toastcrumb must be the only ones privaleged enough to use a seat designed this way.  This must be a storage of prototypes*

Mid thought a second light bloomed to life from somewhere behind him illuminating a comforting white patch of black wall.  Turning to check there wasn't a malfunction with the light seen when he came in, William was startled to see that light was now dimmer than before. Exposing fewer air particles, and this new light was both further up, and somehow further back.

*The manual didn't say anything about this.  Maybe an introductory projection of the new manual is 
 required*

  "Any improvement that achieves 10% or greater is required to be accompined by a projection to explain how an accomplishment of this magnituted was constructed, and the requirements for implementation." William quietly recited the relevant portion of the manual of Law to himself. 

The next thing William knew the 2nd light changed color and text began to appear on the large white patch of wall, now almost as black as it's previous surroundings.  William had never before seen the process in which manuals were assembled, just know that words gave general and sometimes explicit instructions for everything known to man (or at least William).

As the assembly proceeded and finished William read:

*At this stage the manual of truth is unfit for the unselected citizens to be made aware of.  If you are incapable of retaining the information presented here within yourself, unable to recite the incomplete manual to any other citizen you must excuse yourself now.*

"Wanda isn't aware of my preference for Chris B. This is a simple instruction" William proclaimed to the empty space around him (she did know, and it was not).

Almost as if somebody *was* listening, the text disappeared and William had something he would later come to call "an experience".

___
"My introduction to the manual of truth was in a dark, poorly sanitized space. It was a projection paired with the manual. Just like Webby projections allow is to absorb when there is a 10% or greater increase in productivity in a single area and a manual is updated."

"But this projection, was unlike any I have absorbed before. It was not about the importance of the improvement."

"So I'll replay the projection through a vocally transmitted recall to help you understand."

"An all metal citizen is seen carrying what can only be a much larger, older version of a vaporizing euthinasia device.  And it projected vocals, within the the manual projection, it's vocals were 'We must end Cara Honor'
