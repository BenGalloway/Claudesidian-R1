Prev: [[Dystopia - Scene 1]]

William begins his descent into Infrastructure, Inc's lesser know sub-level basement system.

An average man in his late 30's, William has worked for Infrastructure Inc since the day he finished his primary educational curriculum. Much like the majority of his peers.  And just like their parents before them, and their parents before that. 

Try as he might William was unable to reach the status of "exemplary" within the curriculum. Those that did received special placement into the "advanced curriculum", which translates to William as important enough work to not be seen after primary.

As his first foot descends onto sub-level 2's floor it strikes William, *20 years navigating within this building for work related tasks and I've never been made aware this portion of the building was constructed.*

William begins to review the labels on the various doors as he passes each.  

Retarders: Flame, Water, Brain
Safety: Vests, Lights, First
