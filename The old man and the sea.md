This title is considered a classic with good reason. While this is my first exploration of an **Ernest Hemingway** iceberg, *The Old Man and The Sea* will continue to be regarded as a piece of American literature history. 

A simple disguise. A story about an old fisherman, well past his prime years, still doing something meant to be done by younger men. Revered by those that have taken it upon themselves to know Santiago. Speculation in the looks from those that haven't. He remains respected throughout the entire community. 

His apprentice, a boy named Manoulin, recently started working on a different boat. His parents forced this change after nearly 2 months of not catching a fish with the Santiago. Santiago believed his luck had been used up. But the next morning, he wakes up while the sun is still sleeping, boards his skiff, and does what he believes he is born to do. 

As luck would have it, Santiago hooks a fish so large it wouldn't fit in his boat. And he endures a 2-day battle with it. 

During this fight Santiago's inner character is revealed to us as readers. Not in a poetic description of heroism. Not in a lyrical flashback of prime years. But by his actions, his thoughts, and his words during and after battling an enormous fish for days.  Alone. In the open ocean. 

As this is a classic title many reviews, and deep dives have been done already on this title. Mostly centered on the famous quote, "A man can be destroyed but not defeated", solidifying Santiago's quiet nobility. But he has a line before this that I think is even more powerful when overlaid on Hemingway's prose.

"I have no pride".  This line is arguably the true base of every ounce of regality given to our character. 

His ability to carry no egocentric pride is an entirely different frame for this story. Santiago is not noble for his endurance. He is not noble because of victory or defeat. He is noble because the result was accepted. There was no joy after winning the battle. There was physical pain when the first bite is taken from the Marlin. He see himself as a fish. And therefore sees the fish as a brother he simply bested in a competition he knew he carried an advantage in.

And then he thanked his brother. For the fight and his sacrifice. Santiago was willing to die to best himself. Because it was what that day *was.*
