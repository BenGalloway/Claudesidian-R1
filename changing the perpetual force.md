When you live your life by a [[personality ethic]], caring more about the way your viewed by the public eye.  Filled with [[fear]] of the image being shattered you live with a [[perpetual force]] of negativity.  All the [[feedback loop opportunities]] you come across are seen from a lens of "How will this make me look?"  These [[repetition]](repetitions) of repeated answers are your [[programmed responses]] to external [[stimulus]] doing what feels right to maintain what you believe your image is.  But the moment you release your [[preconceived]] story book character you carry on your shoulders, real [[change]] can be effected and a new kind of [[character]] can be born.
