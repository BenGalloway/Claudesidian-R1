Here's a challenge writing prompt: Write a happy story in just 3 words.

Scrolling along the Substack void I encountered this challenge myself.  In a good mood, and with a fun, light hearted exercise with a clear direction. To achieve maximum creative impact with a limited number of words. I hit the reply button.

I instinctively wrote my three words and proceeded to scroll the other answers to the deviously simple exercise. 

I will, for sanity, omit the garbage trolls' replys.

There were many iterations of the same thing. I.e. "they finally kissed", "they lived happily,", "I woke up", "it was finished".

Don't take where I'm going as a critique of these stories. I'm simply pointing to a generality to make a point. Which we'll arrive to eventually.

All of these responses to this prompt are entirely valid. They stand alone in the realm of relatable emotions.  But they feel like a selfie on a wall of family portraits. 

They all share a distinct similarity. All of them rely on assumptions of personal victory. Where a single entity stands alone in triumph, surrounded by a void of nothingness.

My response?

We finally got there.  My instinct led me to the three words, "the sun rose."

The other response that distinguished itself was, "he's in remission."

Maybe a sudden knot in your stomach lurched.  Potentially, goose bumps rose on your skin. Or, I'm the one with problems and emotions evoked from crafted words aren't the point.

Jest's aside, the question remains.  Did those two examples register on a different scale? Was the difference present? 

They common responses depict a simple fairy tale.  The knight saving the princess, so to speak.  It feels good but the characters are empty shells. Hollow as a bird bone.

The other two, those victories were personal, without a doubt.  But they were witnesses to the victories of others, while simultaneously having theirs witnessed.

They aren't the knight in the story. They are a peasant in the village hosting the parade for the knights return. Jubilant at a victory they fought for
