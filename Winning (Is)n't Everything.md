Here's a challenge writing prompt: Write a happy story in just 3 words.

Scrolling along the Substack void I encountered this challenge myself.  In a good mood, and with a fun, light hearted exercise with a clear direction. To achieve maximum creative impact with a limited number of words. I hit the reply button.

I instinctively wrote my three words and proceeded to scroll the other answers to the deviously simple exercise. 

I will for both of our sanity's sake, omit the garbage trolls reply's.

There were many iterations of the same thing. I.e. "they finally kissed", "they lived happily,", "I woke up", "it was finished".

Don't take where I'm going as a critique of these stories. I'm simply pointing to a generality to make a point. Which we'll arrive to eventually.
