[[progress]] and [[excitement]] are intertwined all across human history.  From a caveman learning to start and control a fire to eat, to Einstein's discovery of the theory of relativity.  You see it in things like movies, read about it in fantastical fiction where the bad guy always gets what he deserves because of the persistence of the protagonist.  This is a [[core concept]] that is trying to be taught to us during our earliest science lessons in grade school.  But every medium where these two things are in essence the same thing, they never describe the [[work ethic]] that accompanied the [[Exploration]] to the great revelation.

It's easy to take the [[conditioning]] rendered by those that give you these ideas as a package and blame them, but ultimately, it was also given to them that way, and in order to get younger people excited about things like becoming an engineer, or a doctor who investigates possible cures into cancer, you need to know that the end result for a break through will inevitably lead the majority of the population to carry these two things together.  They and I will celebrate the doctor who cures the common cold, just the same as we will the one that puts an end to cancer once and for all.  But among those celebrating the [[progress]], how many will be celebrating the [[effort]]?  How many will celebrate the amount of time dedicated to simply [[develop ideas]] and, the [[actions]] taken to make those ideas the [[new reality]]?

While I aim to hopefully be one of the very few to recognize those things, that puts me in a very small minority.  Most will simply celebrate the [[accomplishment]], the outcome, the things it opens up for them.  Self preservation is natural and even expected in the scenario that cancer no longer plagues the human population the way it does now.  But the person who ends it for all humanity won't be remembered for the [[Child-like Wonder]] they carried into adult hood, into their profession, and into this immense task.  They'll simply be remembered for the outcome.  Because that outcome is the output. Or, the thing that moves us in the direction of [[progress]].  The entire world will celebrate with excitement, but none will even come close to the [[excitement]] of the discovery in the moment.  When the person who discovers the next great thing that propels humanity forward into the next age is sat there admiring or questioning and double checking their work.  They may not ever truly be able to express the emotions they feel in that moment.  But, I can guarantee they will be able to perfectly recall the emotions they felt during all the failed attempts, all the setbacks, all the encountered problems.  These, they will be able to recall perfectly, not because they dwell on them, but because these are the moments the solidified their resolve, even if it was questioned first.  These are the moments when they were pushing their boulder that were the hardest, that made them want to quit.  But they knew if they simply [[Don't stop pushing your boulder]], gravity will overcome friction at the pinnacle.  That peak for them was never about personal glory, or fame, or fortune.  It was about [[personal accomplishment]].  It was about achieving a goal they set for themselves that seemed unattainable.  It was about improving themselves, not the world.  That's the by-product of personal accomplishment.  The chance that your success can radically effect others.
