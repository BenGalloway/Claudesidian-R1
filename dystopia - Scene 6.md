"For the next 3 cycles between Duties Days I would complete my assigned tasks at Infrastructure Inc and escalated my effort returning to the residence. Where the evening structure was unchanged."

"I would now spend the additional 113 seconds gained from my effort escalation absorbing the Webby Projection with Wanda consecutively with the previous addition of four minutes. Following this I would initiate the terminal per our domestic protocol."

"During these three cycles a pattern was recognized.  The mouth flanks began to be sore during initiation of the terminal. Losing approximately three point seven percent daily until falling to zero percent on the first day of the 4th cycle."

"Two cycles following my attention was brought to a fall in production rate at Infrastructure Inc. Task speed depreciation, Task accuracy depreciation. Sixteen points eight percent deficiencies in both indicator metrics."

*Six cycles. I must have failed.  This termination was swift and hasteful. Entirely new type of manual, with similar precision to the existing ones.*

On September 10th, 2096 Williams 113 extra seconds had continued its diminishment.  Parallel to those with Infrastructure Inc. He now only spent 49 extra seconds with Wanda by this point. 

As he progressed through the standard domestic tasks, he progressed to his initiation of the terminal. Upon accessing the Webby Publication he nearly didn't observe it. 

The manual of truth, presenting itself again. With the same uniformity of each instance prior. 

When his neural processing unit deciphered what his orbital receptors had absorbed his improper seating posture corrected itself immediately. 

His orbital receptors lubricating protection system were incapable of performing their duties. 

And the upper flanks of his mouth raised in temperature. 

He stayed this way, incapable of absorbing even the sound from the Webby Projection Wanda was absorbing, for an estimated 87 seconds. 

Then he pressed the screen to display the instruction set for this projection. 

Same times, same door, new label.

*I'm to locate a door labeled Text: Cellular, Sacred, Authorial.*

When William arrived to the familiar floor of basement he was uninterested in the labels of the surrounding doors. Looking only at the first letter, if unlike the prescribed label given by the manual of truth it was immediately discarded. 

William was required to allocate more time to the discovery of this label. As his inefficient method appeared to have led his navigation further down the sublevel than any previous prior visits. 

*How many doors are present here?*

Then he found it. But the text on this door was different from those he'd encountered during his projection focused visits. 

These letters were reflective. Their saturation made them appear darker, but the reflection they produced reminded William of the yellow light that blinded him briefly. And for another 17 seconds he could only look at these letters before he progressed beyond the threshold. 

Unlike the other two areas, this one was more appropriately illuminated. The room was the most logically correct one yet. As he scanned for the next instruction he saw document cases. Just like the ones used in the document accumulation procedure
