I sit in my corner trying not to hide,
but I came to the safety that I know.
To the place that I always run in stride
truly inline with the way that I feel,
Something I can't express with out this gross lack of appeal

Bring me your stories
Bring me your tears
I'll write them all down for you my dear.
I am not okay,  and neither are you 
but together we will form a barrier that makes our worries run in fear
