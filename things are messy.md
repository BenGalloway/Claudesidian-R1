This is the default state you are born into. Whether or not you have OCD or are a giant slob living in your own squalor like a pig lives in its own shit.  The world around you, your [[relationships]], the [[distraction]] that's seemingly around every corner.  But you have a [[choice]] to engage or not.  And that's the act of [[discipline]].  Understanding you have this choice, and recognizing when it becomes available to you is actually 2 things. 1) [[unity with self]] or, in other words, controlling what you can control within your own [[circle of influence]].  2) [[practice]] or [[sharpen the saw (habit 7| sharpening your saw]] as often as you can.  [[Identify then decide]].  When [[learning]] to do this early on you will experience an innate amount of [[failure]].  But handled well and taken in stride those failures evolve into [[wisdom]], to naturally know when it's appropriate to use or when it's okay to let your mind wander a little bit.  This wisdom then leads to a profound sense of truly [[belonging]].
