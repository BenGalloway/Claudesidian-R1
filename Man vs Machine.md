John Henry.  Hopefully that name rings a bell. The man that beat the machine, hand chiseling his way through a mountain faster than a steam operated drill could (at least, that's the movie I saw at a younger age).  Folk lore that became synonymous with the heartbeat of American industry post world war 2. A rallying cry used by those blue collar men and woman when they demanded better pay, safety mitigation, weekend freedom and overtime pay. Things that today, are ingrained into the structure of a modern construction workers life. Fought for by those that wore the boots before he.
