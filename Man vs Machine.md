John Henry.  Hopefully that name rings a bell. The man that beat the machine, hand chiseling his way through a mountain faster than a steam operated drill could (at least, that's the movie I saw at a younger age).  Folk lore that become synonymous with the heartbeat of American industry post world war 2. A rallying cry used by those blue collar men in woman when they demanded better pay, safety mitigation, and the many other things modern laborers use without much second thought today.
