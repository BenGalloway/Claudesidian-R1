John Henry.  Hopefully that name rings a bell. The man that beat the machine, manually steel driving his way through a mountain faster than a steam operated drill could (at least, that's the movie I saw at a younger age).  A folktale that became synonymous with the heartbeat of American industry post world war 2. A rallying cry used by blue collar men and women when they demanded better pay, safety regulations, weekend freedom and overtime pay. Things that today, are ingrained into the structure of a modern construction workers life. Fought for by those that wore the boots before they did. 

In the original tale, John Henry beats the steam drill, 13 feet to 9, before he collapsed and died from exhaustion. (This was NOT what happens in the movie from my childhood)
