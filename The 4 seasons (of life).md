#### Spring
Intense time of work. As the ground thaws it needs to be prepped and tilled.  Almost immediately after the filled is ready for planting, then you have to plant.  It's a sprint. It's hard, deliberate and purposeful.  But in order for you to be at your best you need to completely focus on the single task that is potentially essential to your survival in the worst case scenario and a reasonable way to earn an income in a less intense version.  But It's the time you spend doing nothing but focusing on the seeds your planting for future you.

#### Summer
Chores are still present and require some of your focus but much less intensely than in the planting season of spring.  Fences need mended, weeds need pulled, but these things don't require the same amount of focus that Spring did.  And as you keep knocking out that chore list, you'll find you'll have more free time.  That free time is the freedom to explore.  In your younger years that's probably more of a physical term, going outside exploring the area your spending your youth, getting lost in the woods and learning to find your way out.  As somebody with a bit more responsibility, this is where you really start to tackle things you've been putting off.  The fields are showing stalks that get taller daily, their not being invaded by weeds.  Start to learn a new skill, go build that treehouse for your kids.  All these things that give you quality time for self-improvment whether you're aware of it or not, that just keep getting pushed back and back and back.  

#### Fall
The celebration of harvest time.  Food is bountiful, family is in from out of town.  It's almost ecstasy.  This is the time to celebrate your hard work during the spring and summer period.  You celebrate your success your and your triumphs in overcoming obstacles.  You celebrate your failures even more.  Because failing in an endeavor doesn't always mean your were bad at it and shouldn't have tried in the first place.  Maybe, you just found out something you thought you would enjoy just wasn't something that brought you the joy you were seeking.  So, you decided to put it down and walk away.  Sure you *failed* in some sense but you took a chance and *learned* along the way. 

#### Winter
Cold, uniform, desolate misery.  That's how most see the winter period.  It can be some of the most difficult times you can think of off the top of your head.  But instead of embracing the hardship and simply enduring it.  Use this time, reflect on the 3 season that came before this one.  Use this time to understand the mistakes you made in order for you plans for the next one to be fool proof.
