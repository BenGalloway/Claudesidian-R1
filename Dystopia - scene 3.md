After a suboptimal sleep cycle, William woke the next day.  Still nauseated by last night's projection.  

*I can't remember seeing a projection like that before.* Thought William, on his normal commute to work. *And all the characters seemed to have a similar summation of teeth. Webby Media Conglomerate should find more anchors that share this characteristic.  I'd absorb more with Wanda if they did.*

And, despite his lack of appropriate rest, William went about his day at work.  Keeping the previous night's instructions from the manual, William quietly went about his scheduled work blocks. Avoiding communication that would be filed as, non-advancement of system progress.

But he forgot what day today was.  Mandatory fun was on the schedule for, as far as William knew, the entire workforce at Infrastructure, Inc.  

Mandatory fun was held every July 24th, as a collective recollection of societies unification, and subsequent liberation from the evils present so many generations ago.  It involved every person receiving a questionnaire.  The questions were only able to answered with a "true" or "false". 

All participants were given an empty section of schedule. Twenty-five minutes, to take part in the mandatory fun period.  When the period of fun ended, the forms were deposited into a document processing machine, found at each desk.  A small black box, that when paper was inserted, made a loud, almost ominous tone.  And all of them working in unison made a tremendous hum that was felt throughout the building.

As William prepared to process his, he hesitated.  Glancing at the final question and his answer. 

"Inability to reconcile information through manual absorption reflects poorly on the citizen." With William having darkened the circle next to the word true. 

Then, a beat behind the rest of Infrastructure Inc's employees, inserted his paper work into the document processor at his desk.

He watched as the processor did its job, turning a whole document into many thin strips, he thinks, *I wonder if there is a manual on restoration processes of documents to pre-processed condition?*

He failed to register that his machine was the final one to conclude its work, and the noise generated by his was the last to be generated, unsynchronized with his peers.

As William recalibrated his sleeping cycles, the routine of his life prior to the manual of truth returned. 

Rising at the same time daily, walking the same distance, to the same place, at the same desk. Six days of the week. 

The seventh day was known as Duties Day. Where all employees of Infrastructure Inc. were not required to fulfill their pre-arranged schedule of tasks. But instead, required to fulfill the duties at their residence. 

Any given Duties Day men could be found, at their preferred time of morning, inserting portable power stations into their Gooberment issued yard height correction systems. And proceed to push the system around their respective properties, correcting the height of the individuals' lawn. 

William, on one of the standard days, was approached by a peer, while he was, unknowingly staring at his document processor, "William, is your task on schedule to fall within the completion deadline?"

William, hesitates with a small start, "Sorry, what? Oh yes. "
