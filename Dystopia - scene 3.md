After a less than suboptimal amount of sleep, William woke the next day.  Still nauseated by last night's projection.  

*I can't ever remember seeing a projection like that before.* Thought William, on his normal commute to work. *And all the characters seemed to have a similar summation of teeth.  Why couldn't Webby Media Conglomerate find more news anchors that shared that characteristic?  I'd absorb more with Wanda if they did.*

And, despite his lack of appropriate rest, William went about his day at work.  Keeping the contract the Gooberment had made with him the night prior.  But he forgot what a "fun" day today was going to be.  Mandatory fun was on the schedule for, as far as William knew, the entire workforce at Infrastructure, Inc.  

Mandatory fun was held every July 24th, as a remembrance of societies unification, and subsequent forced liberation from the evils present so many generations ago.  It involved every person filling out a questionnaire.  There were only "true" or "false" answers.  And at the end of the 25-minute period blocked out and every schedule, the mandatory fun forms were mandatorily put into every one's document processing machine.  A small box, that when used to process documents, made a loud, almost ominous tone.  And all of them working in unison made a tremendous hum that was felt throughout the building.
