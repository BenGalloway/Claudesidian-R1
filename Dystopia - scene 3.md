After a less than suboptimal amount of sleep, William woke the next day.  Still nauseated by last night's projection.  

*I can't ever remember seeing a projection like that before.* Thought William, on his normal commute to work. *And all the characters seemed to have a similar summation of teeth.  Why couldn't Webby Media Conglomerate find more news anchors that shared that characteristic?  I'd absorb more with Wanda if they did.*

And, despite his lack of appropriate rest, William went about his day at work.  Keeping the contract the Gooberment had made with him the night prior.  But he forgot what a "fun" day today was going to be.  Mandatory fun was on the schedule for, as far as William knew, the entire workforce at Infrastructure, Inc.  

Mandatory fun was held every July 24th, as a collective recollection of societies unification, and subsequent liberation from the evils present so many generations ago.  It involved every person receiving a questionnaire.  The questions were only able to answered with a "true" or "false". 

All participants were given an empty section of schedule. Twenty-five minutes, to take part in the mandatory fun period.  When the period of fun ended, the forms were deposited into a document processing machine, found at each desk.  A small black box, that when paper was inserted, made a loud, almost ominous tone.  And all of them working in unison made a tremendous hum that was felt throughout the building.

As William prepared to process his, he hesitated.  Glancing at the final question and his answer. 

"Inability to reconcile information through manual absorption reflects poorly on the citizen." With William having darkened the circle next to the word true. 

Then, a beat behind the rest of Infrastructure Inc's employees, inserted his paper work into the document processor at his desk.

He watched as the processor did its job, turning a whole document into many things strips he thinks, *I wonder if there is a manual for re-assembly of the document to pre-processed condition?*

He failed to register that his machine was the final one to conclude its work, and the noise generated by his was the final one, unsynchronized with his peers.
