[[work ethic]] is usually understood as an outward pouring of effort in order to get a task completed that might otherwise be left undone, typically due to the nature of the task being one of difficult nature.  These tasks can be whatever you dislike doing, whether you hate your job but need to continue going to work to feed your family.  Or, maybe it's cleaning up after an older animal who can't control their bowels any more.  Some may even view work ethic has just work that is hard, like factory workers, or cattle ranchers.  People that live a life that starts every morning before the sunrise and doesn't end until long after it's been set.  But there is a task I've seen far to many people ignore, despite what their personal work ethic might be.  [[personal introspection]].  

But this is where the real [[work ethic]] of somebody is revealed.  By pouring IN to yourself instead of always letting that [[effort]] always pour OUT you can accomplish incredible [[growth]] and through that growth you can experience effective [[change]].  The rule here is "[[Don't stop pushing your boulder]]", just keep pushing your self forward, one step after another.  Committing to the [[process]] of [[change]] is the way to change [[character]].
