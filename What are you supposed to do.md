That's it.  This time I mean it. You won't see me tomorrow. It feels like I'm a burden to others. 

These can be spoken words. But, more often they are in letters left behind by those that wrote them, just before they attempt to remove their own souls from their body. 

Some of the greatest artists in history are almost glorified in this tragedy. Hemingway, Cobain, van Gogh, all intentionally harming themselves as if their very soul they sought to remove from their vessel of flesh was being tortured by being encased. 

But it isn't just artists that experience this torture. More and more "everyday people" report feelings of [[depression]]. More and more often you turn on the evening news and see a tragic event that's occurred in a public place. A lone person shooting at innocent people in a public space, just to later take their own lives via self-inflicted wounds. 

And as a population of 330 million in the United States, we grieve momentarily.  Then we do nothing about it. 

This isn't about laws or rights, or right and wrong, or good vs. evil. 

This is simply a matter of taking care of somebody who has given up caring about themselves. 

If you're a lucky individual you won't know the experience that is having a loved one work through this crisis. I envy you. I know this does not mean you don't feel the pain and suffering involved. I'm saying you never had to have a mutual friend of a cousin or sibling send you a message they received from your family member stating, "I can't do it yet, I have to wait until I'm covered by health insurance. Then I'm planning on making it look like accident."

I hope you never have to. 

It's been almost 3 years since I had a family member attempt to take their own life. 

I've worked through all 5 stages of grief. But the lingering question I am unable to formulate an acceptable answer to is this: What do you do when a loved one is insistent on taking their own life?

I'm never going to stop trying to help this person. As much as I might have wanted to, I'm not built to quit. Especially when it comes to living. 

Therapy, Counseling, specialized therapy, psychiatry, researching stem cell treatments. 

Those are all things that have been done or considered since I made a 300 mile drive in 3 hours to see my loved one intubated and medically sedated in a hospital room. 

And in the time since, I've seen amazing progress followed by equal levels of regress. 

Nobody cares about me. That's the inner monologue on repeat. 

And I gently pose a question in response, "No? Then why were five people in your room when you woke up from the coma? Did none of us care?"

I don't have the answer. Just more questions.
