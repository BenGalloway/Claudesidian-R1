"The introduction with the Manual of Truth was the night of July 23rd, 2096"

___
"What things are most important to President Toastcrumb today Wanda?" Starting the nightly ritual by asking a question William already knew the response to.

"Can you query again after I've finished absorbing the entertainment William?"
"Of course, spouse." Said while turning to walk away.
"Thank you for being cooperational." Freezing in his tracks, without moving his feet Willam turns is head so Wanda sees only half his face with a single raised brow, "not that kind of cooperation. I'm much to tired for synthesis to occur tonight."
A huff and William followed the familiar path to the terminal. 

Looking around his house as he went, he admired the fashionable construction of their home. The soft, strangely textured tape still visible where the interior construction panels met. The singular wooden table, just large enough to be accompined by the 2 chairs at either end.  He grabbed one of them and sat down at the only other fixture that resembled furniture.  The Gooberment issued terminal 6. 

7% smaller than the terminal 5, it was held up by legs similar to the ones seen on the table.  Though,  he noticed the legs of the terminal were considerably thicker. He hit the button labeled "power" and was met by the 1 of 2 extra sources of light available in the residence. The light of the terminal screen meshed with the light from above and the light from the Gooberment issued entertainment projector, that was currently occupying Wanda's attention.

While William waited for the terminal to finalize it's starting sequence he turned to listen to the entertainment projector to see what was important enough to be projected to the public that day. 

On the screen was President Toastcrumb, an old and extremely wrinkly man.  He appeared to William to resemble the human equivalent of over heated shrink wrap.  Like the heat caused the wrinkles but also his inexplicably short stature.  

The president, in his shrill, almost babyish verbal gait, *"Today was one of the greatest, of one of best days we have ever had in the history of this week"* it was in fact, Tuesday. *"A new historic record was set as we saw an increase in production of zero point four percent...."*

William had enough at that point.  

*I don't know how Wanda absorbs her entertainment with Chris A. On Webby News Projecection, when Chris B. On Webby News Publication seems to have a lower sum of teeth and a better view point.*
