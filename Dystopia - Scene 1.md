"The introduction with the Manual of Truth was the night of July 23rd, 2096"

___
"What things are most important to President Toastcrumb today Wanda?" Starting the nightly ritual by asking a question William already knew the response to.

"Can you query again after I've finished absorbing the entertainment William?"
"Of course, spouse." Said while turning to walk away.
"Thank you for being cooperational." Freezing in his tracks, without moving his feet Willam turns is head so Wanda sees only half his face with a single raised brow, "not that kind of cooperation. I'm much to tired for synthesis to occur tonight."

Shrugging, "it's only been 48 days, what's another one?" Wanda did not replay, entirely reengaged with her task of absorbtion.

Looking around his house as he went, he admired the technical construction of their home. Which, according to the weekend programming from Webby Projection weekend programming, is considered "in" and "hip". Like those words fit a description of something not being placed in a part of anatomy.

The soft, strangely textured tape still visible where the interior construction panels met. The singular wooden table, just large enough to be accompined by the 2 chairs at either end.  He grabbed one of them and sat down at the only other fixture that resembled furniture.  The Gooberment issued terminal 6. 

7% smaller than the terminal 5, it was held up by legs similar to the ones seen on the table.  Though,  he noticed the legs of the terminal were considerably thicker. He hit the button labeled "power" and was met by the 1 of 2 extra sources of light available in the residence. The light of the terminal screen meshed with the light from above and the light from the Gooberment issued entertainment projector, that was currently occupying Wanda's attention.

While William waited for the terminal to finalize it's starting sequence he turned to listen to the entertainment projector to see what was important enough to be projected to the public that day. 

On the screen was President Toastcrumb, an old and extremely wrinkly man.  He appeared to William to resemble the human equivalent of over heated shrink wrap.  Like the heat caused the wrinkles but also his inexplicably short stature.  

The president, in his shrill, almost babyish verbal gait, *"Today was one of the greatest, of one of best days we have ever had in the history of this week"* it was in fact, Tuesday. *"A new historic record was set as we saw an increase in production of zero point four percent...."*

William had enough at that point.  

*I don't know how Wanda absorbs her entertainment with Chris A. On Webby News Projection, when Chris B. On Webby News Publication seems to have a lower sum of teeth and a better delivery than his brother.*

The end of that thought coincided with the terminal having completed it's starting sequence. Which took Williams attention away from the summation of teeth from Chris A. and shifted his focus to the article by Chris B he now had open on the Webby News Publication portal on the terminal. The only thing that accompanied this portal was a library directory.  Home to all known manuals on the planet. Freely accessible with a tap.

As Chris B's article concludes it's summary of the historical 0.44% increase in production being rounded improperly, Willam saw something new at the bottom of the publication.  A box, that read simply, *New Manual Discovery: The Manual of Truth (tap for reading)*

"Wanda, they seem to have discovered a new manual and are announcing it on Webby publication, have you absorbed the Webby Projection talking about it yet?" Wanda did not hear William. And it would be rude had she, after she called him cooperational. He turned back around and tapped where the screen instructed him to.  

The screen of the terminal 6's screen appeared to shut off. "New machines, rolled out without proper documentation..." Then the screen lit back to life, only it looked different. 

The two icons that filled the majority of the available space were gone, and it appeared as if a manual was writing itself, letter by letter, right on to the now voided space. 

*In order to gain full access to the manual of truth, the following steps must be followed. Any falter on the end users part will cause the new manual to instantly be destroyed and never be correctly added to the library.
1: No communication to another citizen is allowed during this process about this process
2: At 12:47 AM tomorrow morning you will get dressed
3: 12:56 AM you start your 2.2 mile walk to the rear entrance of Infrastructure inc.

*More instructions from the manual will be waiting there*

"What a strange manual." Followed by William setting his Gooberment issued watch to wake him exactly at 12:47 AM.  Manuals were always correct, the Gooberment ensured it.
