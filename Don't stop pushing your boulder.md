Don't stop pushing your boulder, when you reach the peak gravity will overcome any friction remaining and you can stay at that peak for as long as you wish.  The work may not be done, but the friction, the once thought impossible, is now not only possible, but it's conquered. the goal was a task, the [[system]] was pushing with one foot in front of the other.  You couldn't see the top but you knew it was there.  Don't let [[challenges]] distract you from your final destination.  And when [[things are messy]] in the beginning, there's nothing sweeter then relishing in the moment of triumph at the dirt streaked on your cheeks, or the sweat equity you gave during this [[process]].
