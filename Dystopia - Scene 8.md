# Dystopia - Scene 8 
William was frozen.

Dizziness was the only tangible sensory experience.

For a 67 seconds William was lost in a spin he didn't initiate intentionally.  But after the short amount of time William once again stabilized him self. Using the simple wooden bench, where Wanda absorbed projections, to maintain his vertical posture.

*How am I going to keep Wanda from finding this?*

Glancing around his residence, William began the search for a temporary place of discretion to place the 'non-manual'.  While William opened the small cup storage container, and peered inside the bulk dry food containment unit he kept glancing at the printed text's cover.  The words on it's face seemed to be an astronomical anomaly.  Like the one's William had trouble grasping in primary school.  The letters "*COLLECTION*" seemed to have a gravitational effect on William.  So strong that the force these letters had sat William on the bench.  Where he opened it and found the next entry.

William peers up from the pages just as the sun begins to spray it's first photon rays over the collection of residences.  Just as he finishes a story titled "A Knights Tail".

William sat for a moment thinking about the entry, written by a citizen named *Saucer*.  He found that the fear of malfunctioning lubrication wasn't warranted with this entry.  He was almost calmed by the numbered lines.  Something he was extremely familiar with.  As all Gooberment approved manuals were printed in this way. But he was unable to fully comprehend this printed line, and he realized he must not waste more time to find a place to put *COLLECTION* in a place where Wanda wouldn't see it. 

The tightness that William had felt earlier was, to his amazement, entirely dissipated.  He calmly walked into the sleeping quarters of the residence. Lifted the corner of resting-pad closest to his cranial angle control device and slid *COLLECTION* under the pad.  Meticulously replacing everything as he had seen it prior. 

With his cheeks reclaiming the soreness he hadn't sensed in multiple cycles, he laid down, questioning how knights battling proved who would win a "muh-I-den's hand in holy matrimony". And what the majority of that even meant.

The hissing had returned.  Less of an ear splitting, piercing hiss, and more of a gentle hum.  Reminding those gathered of a gentle hum. 

With the most calm, steadiest voice any gathered had heard to this point, "I did as the instructions stated."

"I finished the text with labeled *collection*. And I can conclude only one thing. The description that these prints would hold no instructional value was the most correct statement made by the manual of truth."

"Now, these store-eyes weren't completely with out use like most citizens might believe.  I found that the strings printed on those pages enabled the gray matter stored within my cranium was able to...*conjecture* projections.  It was like I was watching Webby projections.  Only the gray matter was producing the images on a screen that was only visible to the one absorbing the material.  This led to many nights where I simply feigned sleep.  Waited for Wanda's breathing pattern to indicate she was asleep. and open *COLLECTION* to the next entry.  I haven't had that level of enthusiasm for absorption since Infrastructure Inc updated the employment terms of service in 2059."

"I must have absorbed an extra 113% with this first 'non-manual'.  And the simple placement under my sleeping-pad's corner proved adequate for this, and all the text's I returned from basement sub-level 2 with."

William continued on. His voice betraying his heightened stimulus to the absorbed material found in *COLLECTION*, *The Journeys of Buckle Ferry Shin*, and *The Old Man Fishing on the Sea* to name a few.  William listed them all.  Every title he encountered during his absorbing process of "store-eyes".  And has he listed each entry, he delivered a brief synopsis of the entry. Followed by any potential sensory malfunctions it caused.  The entire monologue was given with the same tone he began with.  Leaving it to be the sole part of the recording keeping the gathered listeners awake as William marched through each title.
